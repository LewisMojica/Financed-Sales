# AI Workflow Development - Key Decisions & Feedback

**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Context**: Building Frappe-specific AI development workflow as alternative to ContextKit

## Core Problem Identified

**ContextKit Limitations**:
- Claims framework-agnostic but optimized for mainstream frameworks
- File structure templates assume generic layouts (not ERPNext's `app/module/module/` nesting)
- Configuration handling doesn't account for ERPNext Settings DocType patterns
- Uses generic "services" terminology instead of Frappe-specific patterns
- Review-correction cycle is inefficient and time-consuming

**Result**: Slower than manual implementation for Frappe development

## Proposed Solution

**Frappe-Specific Workflow System**:
- Narrow focus: Start with financed_sales app, expand if successful
- Bottom-up development approach
- Multi-agent configuration with Frappe-specific context
- Sequential implementation (no parallel execution initially)

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Bottom-Up Development Strategy
**Approach**: Build execution layer first, then generation layers
1. Create infrastructure for executing Steps.md
2. Create implementation steps by hand to test infrastructure
3. Build infrastructure to generate Steps.md from Tech.md
4. Continue upward through workflow layers

**Advantages**:
- Immediate feedback on what actually works
- Real constraints discovery before building generation layers
- Validates core value proposition early
- Reduces speculation and theoretical planning

### Implementation Steps Design Principles

**Original "Zero Context" Principle**: ❌ **Rejected**
- Would require basically having final code in steps
- Too restrictive and impractical

**Revised Approach**: ✅ **Context-Aware Agents**
- Agents should have Frappe/ERPNext domain knowledge
- Use guidelines similar to ContextKit for framework context
- Steps should be specific but leverage agent expertise

**Specificity Level**: "As detailed as necessary"
- Must be more specific than ContextKit (too vague)
- Will be determined through practice and testing

### Validation Strategy

**File Review Validation**:
- Validation agent to catch errors before execution
- Much cheaper than execution testing
- Prevents error propagation to lower workflow levels
- Build validator using good/bad examples from manual development phase

**Execution Testing**:
- Both file review AND execution testing needed
- File review first, execution testing after review passes

## Risk Management

### Acknowledged Risks
- **ROI Uncertainty**: Weeks/months investment for uncertain productivity gains
- **Scope Creep**: Each piece might need more sophistication than planned
- **Validation Agent Complexity**: Distinguishing good/bad steps is nuanced
- **Documentation Consistency**: Incremental approach might create fragmentation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Iterative Validation**: Build and validate each workflow component incrementally
- **Early Exit Criteria**: Need clear kill switch if not seeing gains after X weeks
- **Real Problem Testing**: Use actual penalty payment fix as test case
- **Agent Selection Testing**: Test multiple agents/configurations

## Success Criteria

**ROI Threshold**: Must be faster than current single-agent micromanagement approach
**Coverage Target**: Feature/Bug work covers ~85% of coding time
**Validation Approach**: Each workflow step validated before building next layer

## Technical Implementation Notes

**File Structure**: ERPNext standard `financed_sales/financed_sales/financed_sales/`
**Configuration**: Use app settings ('penalty income account') not manual setup
**Documentation**: Add Frappe context incrementally as needed, not comprehensive upfront
**Examples**: Save working files as examples for agents during manual development phase

## First Concrete Experiment

**Test Case**: Manual implementation steps for penalty payment fix
**Goal**: Validate if agent can execute detailed, Frappe-specific implementation steps
**Success Metric**: Agent produces working code from hand-written steps
**Multi-Agent Testing**: Test with different agents/configurations for reliability

## Key Insights

1. **Documentation/Planning IS the bottleneck** for agents to develop on Frappe framework
2. **Bottom-up validation** more likely to produce working system than theoretical design
3. **Incremental complexity** better than over-engineering upfront
4. **Real problem focus** eliminates toy problem optimization risk
5. **Framework specificity** may be necessary for niche frameworks like Frappe

**Next Action**: Write detailed implementation steps for penalty payment fix and test agent execution
